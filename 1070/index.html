      <h2>College Policies</h2>
      <p class="fineprint">
      <b>Title IX</b><br/>
      Saint Louis University and its faculty are committed to supporting our students and seeking an environment that is free of bias, discrimination, and harassment. If you have encountered any form of sexual misconduct (e.g., sexual assault, sexual harassment, stalking, domestic or dating violence), we encourage you to report this to the University. If you speak with a faculty member about an incident that involves a Title IX matter, that faculty member must notify SLU’s Title IX coordinator (or that person’s equivalent on your campus) and share the basic facts of your experience. This is true even if you ask the faculty member not to disclose the incident. The Title IX contact will then be available to assist you in understanding all of your options and in connecting you with all possible resources on and off campus.

      For most students on the St. Louis campus, the appropriate contact is Anna R. Kratky (DuBourg Hall, room 36; <a href="mailto:anna.kratky@slu.edu">anna.kratky@slu.edu</a>; 314-977-3886). If you wish to speak with a confidential source, you may contact the counselors at the University Counseling Center at 314-977-TALK. To view SLU’s sexual misconduct policy, and for resources, please visit the following web addresses: <a href="https://www.slu.edu/here4you" target="_blank">https://www.slu.edu/here4you</a> and <a href="https://www.slu.edu/general-counsel" target="_blank">https://www.slu.edu/general-counsel</a>.
      </p>

      <p class="fineprint">
      <b>Disability Accomodations</b><br/>
      Students with a documented disability who wish to request academic accommodations must formally register their disability with the University. Once successfully registered, students also must notify their course instructor that they wish to use their approved accommodations in the course.
      <br />
      Please contact Disability Services to schedule an appointment to discuss accommodation requests and eligibility requirements. Most students on the St. Louis campus will contact Disability Services, located in the Student Success Center and available by email at <a href="mailto:Disability_services@slu.edu">Disability_services@slu.edu</a> or by phone at 314.977.3484. Once approved, information about a student’s eligibility for academic accommodations will be shared with course instructors by email from Disability Services and within the instructor’s official course roster. Students who do not have a documented disability but who think they may have one also are encouraged to contact to Disability Services. Confidentiality will be observed in all inquiries.
      </p>

      <p class="fineprint">
      <b>Academic Integrity</b><br/>
      <em>Academic integrity is honest, truthful and responsible conduct in all academic endeavors.</em> The mission of Saint Louis University is &quot;the pursuit of truth for the greater glory of God and for the service of humanity.&quot;  Accordingly, all acts of falsehood demean and compromise the corporate endeavors of teaching, research, health care, and community service via which SLU embodies its mission. The University strives to prepare students for lives of personal and professional integrity, and therefore regards all breaches of academic integrity as matters of serious concern.  The governing University-level Academic Integrity Policy was adopted in Spring 2015, and can be accessed
      <a href="https://www.slu.edu/provost/policies/academic-and-course/policy_academic-integrity_6-26-2015.pdf">on the Provost&#39;s Office website</a>.
      <br/>
      Additionally, each SLU College, School, and Center has adopted its own academic integrity policies, available on their respective websites.  All SLU students are expected to know and abide by these policies, which detail definitions of violations, processes for reporting violations, sanctions, and appeals.  Please direct questions about any facet of academic integrity to your faculty, the chair of the department of your academic program, or the Dean/Director of the College, School or Center in which your program is housed.
